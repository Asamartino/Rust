// Instructions
// Implement a clock that handles times without dates.

// You should be able to add and subtract minutes to it.

// Two clocks that represent the same time should be equal to each other.

// You will also need to implement .to_string() for the Clock struct. We will be using this to display the Clock's state.
// You can either do it via implementing it directly or using the Display trait.

// Did you implement .to_string() for the Clock struct?

// If so, try implementing the Display trait for Clock instead.

// Traits allow for a common way to implement functionality for various types.

// For additional learning, consider how you might implement String::from for the Clock type. You don't have to actually implement thisâ€”it's redundant with Display,
// which is generally the better choice when the destination type is Stringâ€”but it's useful to have a few type-conversion traits in your toolkit.
